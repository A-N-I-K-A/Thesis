This project presents a hybrid cryptographic framework that ensures robust security for user data using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) combined with a Secret Sharing Scheme. The goal is to enable strong, scalable, and efficient encryption while ensuring secure data distribution and reconstruction using modern cryptographic techniques.

üîê Key Features

‚úÖ Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for lightweight yet secure encryption.

‚úÖ Secret Sharing Scheme for secure key distribution and redundancy.

‚úÖ Data Confidentiality and Integrity ensured via hybrid cryptographic protocols.

‚úÖ Built with Python, utilizing well-established cryptography libraries.
